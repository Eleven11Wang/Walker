# python-rwr

Requires modules `networkx`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `argparse`.

For a description of the Random Walk with Restart (RWR) algorithm, see the paper by Kohler et al. at [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929708001729](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929708001729).

This module was initially created to run node removal experiments with two separate graphs, but the code in matrix\_main.py could be modified to run the standard RWR on a single graph.
